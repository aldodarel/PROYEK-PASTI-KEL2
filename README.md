## Proyek Akhir Mata Kuliah PASTI

This project is a web-based Church Administration System developed for GKPI (Gereja Kristen Protestan Indonesia) Sipoholon Congregation. It adopts a microservice architecture to modularize core features such as authentication, church servant management, congregation family records, and sector information. Each service is built independently using Go or PHP and communicates via REST APIs. The front-end is developed using Laravel, while each microservice maintains its own database. This system aims to streamline administrative tasks and enable efficient data management for church leaders and staff.
